CRO (clustered regressional optimization) is an efficient regressional algorithm for machine learning being developed by William Stobaugh.


The theory behind the algorithm is that any unknown function that most reduces lost can be approximated by a large series of linear lines, at the cost of a "perfect" function, vast quantaties of high dimensional data can be computed into a regressional relationship without the large computation needed for methods like back propagation.
